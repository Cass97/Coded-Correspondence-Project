# Coded-Correspondence-Project
This was an off-platform project as part of the Python Strings module in Codecademy.
It was used for practical learning of Python Strings. Also demonstrates understanding of Python loops, booleans and functions.
I uploaded this notebook to GitHub long after I completed the project. It is unclear why the last two answers are missing as I am sure I would have completed them at the time. 
As with other Codecademy Q&A style projects, I have elected to leave any mistakes or omissions I notice at the time of uploading. This is because they are intended to be a record of my learning only and not judged as a formal assessment.
